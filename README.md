# Streams – app for making notes and saving data

Currently, it’s very first prototype

## Goal of app

- allow people to make notes in simple way, and help to learn and remember stuff

## Code goals

- base on React
- make it modular and composable – as many little components as reasonable
- if-less code – currently, one if expression used in whole code (with objective to delete it later, somehow)
- make it functional – rely on dataflow, passing values through functions, functions through functions, avoid if’s (look up)

## Design goals

Typography first, typography in the middle, typography last. Each design element has to have meaning, if wants to exists. Each color has to have reason, each line, each border, each background. Looking for beauty in simplicity, not in ornaments, looking for perfect balance in relation between space and letters

## Behavior goals

- allow user to control whole app with keyboard. First steps were made
